# lem-opengl

This is a frontend for [lem](https://github.com/cxxxr/lem). 
It is based on the ncurses frontend.
It renders lem to an OpenGL texture, making it easy to use in OpenGL enabled apps. 
Input and windowing is handled by [https://github.com/terminal625/sucle](https://github.com/terminal625/sucle) which is not yet available on quicklisp.
